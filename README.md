Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The two artifacts I chose to upload that best reflects my work in this class is the Milestone 2 project and the final project. In the 2nd milestone I was tasked with programming the microcontroller to turn on/off depending on if "ON"/"OFF" were typed on the keyboard as an input. The final project was to program the microcontroller to act as a thermostat. The side GPIO buttons were used to control the set temperature and the I2C was used to read the temperature from the sensor in the microcontroller. UART was used to display the temp, set temp, heat on/off as binary, and elapsed seconds of the system and the red output light was programmed to turn on if the temp was below the set point (effectively turning the heat "on").

What did you do particularly well?

I think that in these assigments, I was able to pick up on how different functions of the microcontroller interacted with each other and how to implement the funcitonality of each assignement by unerstanding these functions. I also think that my task scheduler setup was efficient and effective.

Where could you improve?

I think that the implemetation of state machines was the most complicated part of the class for me in terms of applying the concept. Milestone 3 was difficult for me to understand, but I eventually figure it out.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the biggest thing this term that I learned was to lean on my peers a bit for concepts I didn't understand and work as a team to push forward with difficult assigments. I tend to fly solo when it comes to my academic career but have a feew peers to bounce ideas off of was extremely helpful for this class.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The most transferable skill that I learned from this class is understanding imported header and class files and how they can be used together to implement different functionalities in code. Taking the time to read through and understand now they work really helped pull everything together for an assignment.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think that the final project was my best work in regards to organization of code and annotation of how things were working. This makes the code so much more eas to read and maintain if other features are going to be implemented in the future.
